# Titanic Survival Prediction Model
CREATED BY KISHAN CHAUHAN
## Project Overview

This project uses the Titanic dataset to create a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived or not. It serves as an introductory problem for novice machine learners, covering data analysis, feature engineering, and model building.

## Project Highlights

- **Dataset**: The Titanic dataset contains passenger details such as age, gender, class, fare, cabin, and survival.

- **Data Preprocessing**: Added features to improve model performance, handled missing values, and transformed categorical data.

- **Model Selection**: Developed and benchmarked several ML models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to select the most accurate one.

- **Evaluation**: The model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Skills Utilized

- Machine Learning
- Scikit-Learn
- Data Modeling
- Data Cleaning
- Data Collection

## Conclusion

This project allowed me to practice skills on a real-life dataset with applied feature engineering and model evaluation in machine learning.
